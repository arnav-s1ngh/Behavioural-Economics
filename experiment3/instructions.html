    <h2>Payoff Tables</h2>
    <p>
        You are about to participate in an experiment in the economics of decision-making.
        If you follow these instructions carefully and make good decisions, you might earn
        a considerable amount of money that will be paid to you in cash at the end of the
        experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment will consist of a series of separate decision-making periods. Each
        period consists of two phases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase I:</strong> You will be paired with another person. Based on your combined actions, you will earn points.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase II:</strong> You will have the opportunity to earn dollars based on the points you earned in Phase I.</li>
    </ul>
